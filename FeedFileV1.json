When their elderly neighbor Astrid (JoAnn F. Peterson) comes into the picture, it\u2019s the least of Mike (Jeremy Gladen) and Cindy\u2019s (Luba Hansen) expectations that she will change everything.  Her clever and mysterious ways confound everyone around her, including her Pastor (Dean Cain).\n\nAstrid seems to have all the answers and promptly sets her plan into action.  With wisdom, intuition, and maybe a little bit of help from above, she makes everything turn out just right. There are still good stories to tell, and this is certainly one of those \u201cfeel-good\u201d movies you\u2019ll remember.\n Emotional, humorous, and a little bit mysterious, some things you just can\u2019t explain.  There are bigger things at work, than what we understand.  Accept them with trust, and be grateful.  And have faith that good things will happen.\n\nBased on the award winning book by Michael Tourville, titled the same, 'A Promise to Astrid' stars Dean Cain and is scheduled for release in 2019.\u200b",

      "shortDescription": "\"If you don't win, don't come home.\" - Jasper Weaver\n\nAs a young man, Jasper 'Buck' Livingston made a decision that influenced and forever changed American cowboy culture. Even through disappointment, hardship, and failure, Buck's incredible journey as a north Texas rodeo cowboy, rancher, father, and preacher proved that every life matters, and even ordinary men can live a life filled with extraordinary purpose.\n\nNAIL 32 is an exciting and emotional true-life story that champions the importance of being courageous, honorable, and truly God-fearing.\n\nCan a cowboy be a Christian? Can a Christian be a cowboy?\n\nWhile exploring the answers to some of life's toughest questions, NAIL 32 encourages all men to stand up and walk with God. And never, ever sell your soul or your saddle, because...life's a long, long, ride.\n\nFor more information, visit www.JCFilms.org.",
